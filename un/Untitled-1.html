<p id="para1">Tsunamis pose a serious threat, especially to women, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly. This year's World Tsunami Awareness Day (5 November) aims to raise awareness about reducing risks and enhancing community preparedness. Although rare, tsunamis can be devastating, with an average death toll of 4,600 per disaster. The 2023 theme, "Fighting Inequality for a Resilient Future," calls for all-society engagement and partnership in disaster risk reduction.</p>
